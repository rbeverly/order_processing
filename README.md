# order_processing

This is part of what I'm using to calculate taxes and such for incoming product orders.
At the moment it is unclear exactly what functionality we'll need. Most likely it will read a database of orders, calculate some taxes, prefill a few governemnt forms, and export to formats useful to the accounting department.
